# telegram-webhook

Forty by croc100


This example demonstrates how to use a webhook in a Telegram bot to inspect or process intermediate values from a server other than the user interface.

To run this example, follow the steps below:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' with your Telegram Bot API token in the code.
3. Replace 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL' with the URL where you want to inspect intermediate values.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code.
5. Install the required dependencies by running the command: `npm install`.
6. Start the server by running the command: `node index.js`.
7. Once the server is running, use the following endpoint to set the webhook URL:
   - GET /setWebhook/YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
8. After setting the webhook, any messages sent to your Telegram bot will trigger an HTTP POST request to the specified webhook URL. The server will log the received message and you can inspect or process any intermediate values as needed.
9. Customize the logic in the `/webhook/${botToken}` endpoint to handle the received messages and perform desired response actions.

Note: Make sure the webhook URL is publicly accessible and uses HTTPS for security purposes.
